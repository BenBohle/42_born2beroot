born2beroot is a really simple System Administration related exercise


The mandatory Task was about creating a virtual machine and make some
important and security related things.
Also writing a monitoring.sh script. The monitoring.sh Script
doesnt show much but its a good example how you can get a good Overview about your machine.

Bonus part:
Set up a functional WordPress website with the following services: lighttpd, MariaDB, and PHP.
And set up a custom Service by your choice

How my born2beroot Bonus Wordpress Website looks: (I know the task was only to install wordpress not making a site ðŸ˜…)
